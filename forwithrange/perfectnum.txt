1. ask from the user the number to check n=6
2. declare sum=0 if the sum of divisor comes out to be 0
3. for loop starts with the range(1,num)

iteration:1: num=1
             if n%num==0 its to check wether num is the divisior of n or not "TRUE"
             sum+=num=sum=0+1=1

iteration:2: num=2
             if n%num==0 its to check wether num is the divisior of n or not "TRUE"
             sum+=num=sum=1+2=3

iteration:3: num=3
             if n%num==0 its to check wether num is the divisior of n or not "TRUE"
             sum+=num=sum=3+3=6

iteration:4: num=4
             if n%num==0 its to check wether num is the divisior of n or not "FALSE"
             
iteration:5: num=5
             if n%num==0 its to check wether num is the divisior of n or not "FALSE"
