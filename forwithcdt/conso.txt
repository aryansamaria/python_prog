1. take input from the user(ar12)
2. initializing count 0 if there are no digit prresent

for loop--
 iteration:1:  i='a'--if condition (using i.isalpha() we can check this i is alphabet and check wether the i is present in v or not) "TRUE" count+=1 COUNT=1

 iteration:2:  i='r'--if condition (using i.isalpha() we can check this i is alphabet and check wether the i is present in v or not) "TRUE" count+=1 COUNT=2

 iteration:3:  i='1'--if condition (using i.isalpha() we can check this i is alphabet and check wether the i is present in v or not) "FALSE" COUNT=2

 iteration:4:  i='2'--if condition (using i.isalpha() we can check this i is alphabet and check wether the i is present in v or not)  "FALSE" COUNT=2

 3. print count
